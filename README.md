# airsensor-py

Python package for getting sensor values from an Ambient Air Sensor such as offered by [Rehau](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Rehau-USB-Stick-Ambient-Sensor/dp/B00ZXP6EI4).

## Getting Started

This section will introduce you to airsensor-py and how to install and use it for fun and profit.

### Prerequisites

Make sure that python 3 + pip is installed.

### Installing

```
pip install airsensor-py
```

## Usage

You can either use this package as a library in your code or using the bundled CLI. You'll have to run it as root or set up a udev rule to grant r/w access to the device to the user. For more instructions on that, see [here](https://github.com/tuxedo0801/usb-sensors-linux).

### Library

```
from airsensor.core import AirSensor
airsensor = AirSensor()
voc = airsensor.get_voc()
print(voc)

> 450
```

### CLI

```
$ airsensor-py

> 450
```
